hello! This webapp can be started with 'node index.js'. You will need to use the included version of the database for the database stuff to work, 
as I made some modifications (added password fields). The internal client-side portal can be accessed via localhost:8000/getAllAgents

Some incomplete features:
*secure login/homepage for internal portal
*shopping cart
*checkout
